    <h1>How To Make A Sandwich</h1>
    <!-- Below is a paragraph -->
    <p>Since the very first creation of sandwiches, from as early as 1762 with John Montagu, sandwiches have been the
      <br>pinnacle of convenience and comfort in the world of food. But, how should one go about creating their own
      <br> sandwiches? Everyone has a preference, but sometimes it's hard to envision what ingredients you want between
      <br>your two slices of bread. How do you decide which ingredients you want and which you do not want? How do you 
      <br>look at your own reflection and not crumble under the pressure of a society that expects you to stretch
      <br>yourself into perfection, working your life away for scraps of money until you're old, loose skin and bones 
      <br>with nothing left for you, followed by the dread of existence, a depression accompanied by loss and questioning 
      <br>who you once were and where all of your wasted talents went? Well, folk! Lookie here! Because this site was 
      <br>made solely to help you figure out how to go about making your sandwich! All that's needed is to look and 
      <br>select your options below, see what you like and dislike, and create your perfect sandwich!
